# Brief Introduction About Myself
Hello! My name is Refilwe Hope Lekganyane. I’m a student who’s passionate about learning, technology, and growth.  
I enjoy exploring how digital tools can solve real-world problems and make people’s lives easier.  
This project is helping me understand Git and GitHub better, especially how to manage files, branches, and collaborate effectively.
