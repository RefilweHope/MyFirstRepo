# Reflection on What I’ve Learned

So far in this course, I’ve learned how Git helps manage versions of my work efficiently.  
I now understand how to create repositories, make commits, and push changes to GitHub.  
I’ve also learned about collaboration through forking, branching, and pull requests — skills that are essential for teamwork in real-world projects.
